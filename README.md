# Bridging the gap between Bitcoin and convenience

**PeerPay** is a platform that allows you to pay for electricity bills, buy airtime, and access other essential utilities — using Bitcoin. It's designed to bridge the gap between cryptocurrency and day-to-day financial needs in Zambia and beyond.

## 🚨 Problem

1. Bitcoin transactions often involve long wait times and complicated processes.
2. Zambia has yet to fully adopt Bitcoin as a mainstream financial tool.
3. The country risks lagging behind in technological advancement and its Vision 2030 goals.

## 💡 Solution

**PeerPay** enables direct Bitcoin-to-Kwacha transactions. Here's how it works:

1. Select the utility you want to pay for.
2. The app generates a **Lightning Network invoice** instantly.
3. You pay it using your Bitcoin wallet.
4. The recipient receives the full amount in **Kwacha**, directly to their **mobile money** account.

> 🛰️ An offline version of the platform will also be available to overcome network issues.
